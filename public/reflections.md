# Q1 End of Lessons Reflections

## 1. Topics I Know Very Well

1. **Variable Declaration**  
   I feel pretty confident with declaring variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`. At first it was a bit confusing which one to use, but after doing different exercises I got the hang of it. I can now easily store and update values depending on what the program needs.

2. **Input and Output Functions**  
   I understand how to use `prompt()` and `console.log()` since we practiced them a lot. It’s clear to me that prompt lets the user give input, while console.log is for showing results. I like this topic because it makes programs more interactive and not just plain code.

3. **Arithmetic Operators**  
   The operators are simple because they’re just like doing math. Using `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` in JavaScript felt familiar since we already know them in regular math. We also used these operators for Phyton and C++ so I'm already pretty familiar with them.  And doing short exercises with numbers really helped me get used to them quickly.

4. **Selection Structures**  
   I got used to using `if`, `else if`, and `else` because they make the program follow conditions. It’s nice to see how the code changes depending on the situation given. I find this topic easy because the logic is straightforward once you think step by step.

5. **HTML Tags**  
   I can say I know the basics of HTML tags, especially the common ones like `<p>`, `<h1>`, and `<button>`. Since we used them during activities, I understand how they connect with JavaScript. It was actually fun to see how tags affect what shows on the page.


## 2. Topics I Need More Practice With

1. **While Loops**  
   I know how they work, but I still mess up with the conditions sometimes. It’s tricky because if I make a small mistake, the loop can go on forever.    

2. **Do…While Loop**  
   I get the idea that it runs at least once, but I’m not always sure when I should use it instead of a normal while loop. I need more practice to really see the difference.  

3. **For…In Loop**  
   I can explain what it does but honestly I don’t feel confident using it yet. We didn’t use it that much, so I need more examples to understand how it’s useful.  

4. **Nested Loops**  
   These are confusing for me because I have to keep track of two loops at the same time. I know the concept, but applying it feels difficult, especially when the problem looks complicated.  

5. **Break and Continue Statements**  
   I get mixed up when I should use `break` or when I should use `continue`. Sometimes I end up misusing them and my code doesn’t run the way I expect.  


## 3. My Plan of Action

To get better with these topics, I plan to read more of the readings our teacher gave us and try to review them again at home. I also want to watch YouTube lessons since they usually explain loops step by step with good examples. Aside from that, I’ll practice coding small programs on my own so I can remember the flow better. If I still struggle, I’ll ask help from my classmates and friends, and of course I’ll also ask Sir Roy whenever I really can’t figure it out.


## 4. Effective and Not Effective Activities

### ✅ Effective Activities
1. **Working with seatmates** – I find this effective because we share ideas and explain things to each other. It’s easier to understand when someone explains in their own words.  
2. **Asking Sir Roy directly** – Whenever I ask sir about my code, he explains it clearly and I understand it faster compared to just trying to figure it out alone.  

### ❌ Not Effective Activities
1. **Doing an activity without guidance first** – I sometimes get lost when we’re asked to do something right away without much explanation. I feel like I waste time guessing what to do.  
2. **Long straight lectures** – I get distracted easily during very long discussions, so I prefer shorter explanations with more practice right after.
