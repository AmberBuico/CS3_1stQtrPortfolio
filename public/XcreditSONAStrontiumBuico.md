# Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.
### by Amber Daphne A. Buico  |  9 - Strontium

## Key points I found interesting ❗
-> The government is working on giving P20 per kilo rice to more areas through Kadiwa stores.
-> Free college education is still being offered, and there's a goal for one graduate per Filipino family.
-> The Love Bus will be revived as free transportation in Cebu and Davao.

## Key points I found weird 🤔
-> The Love Bus thing felt kind of random, but maybe it’s more symbolic or historical...?

## Reflection paragraphs
After watching and reading about the SONA 2025, I noticed that President Marcos focused a lot on helping poor families, especially in agriculture, education, and health. I like that there’s support for small businesses and more jobs, because many Filipinos are still struggling. The part about free laptops and overtime pay for teachers also stood out to me, because it shows support for our education system. It seems like the government is trying to make sure no Filipino is left behind.

However, even though the speech was full of promises, I hope these projects actually happen and not just stay as plans. I also feel like some problems, like internet and electricity in faraway areas, have been promised for years already. Still, I think the message of unity and hope was clear, and the president ended it on a strong note. Overall, I felt hopeful but also unsure if all these goals will be met.

## My word for the Philippines
**"Kapit lang!"**
